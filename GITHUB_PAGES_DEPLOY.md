4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The deployment will start automatically!

- Wait 2-3 minutes for the initial deployment

## 📱 PWA Installation Testing

### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):
1. Visit your GitHub Pages URL
2. Look for the install icon (⊕) in the address bar
3. Click to install as desktop app
4. App should work offline after installation

### On Mobile:
1. Visit your GitHub Pages URL on mobile browser
2. Tap browser menu → **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. Confirm installation
4. App icon appears on home screen
5. Opens like native app when tapped

## ✅ PWA Functionality Checklist

After deployment, test these features:

### 🔧 Service Worker
- [ ] Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- [ ] Should show "radiowave-v1.0.0" as registered
- [ ] Status should be "activated and running"

### 📦 Caching
- [ ] Open DevTools → Application → Storage
- [ ] Should see cached files under Cache Storage
- [ ] Disconnect internet, reload page - should still work

### 🎵 Core Features
- [ ] Radio stations load and play
- [ ] Search and filters work
- [ ] Favorites can be added/removed
- [ ] File upload works for My Music section
- [ ] Audio controls function properly

### 📱 PWA Features
- [ ] Install prompt appears on desktop
- [ ] "Add to Home Screen" works on mobile
- [ ] App opens in standalone mode when installed
- [ ] Works offline (uploaded music, favorites, cached stations)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### PWA Not Installing?
1. **Check HTTPS**: GitHub Pages uses HTTPS by default ✅
2. **Check Console**: Open DevTools → Console for errors
3. **Check Manifest**: DevTools → Application → Manifest
4. **Check Service Worker**: DevTools → Application → Service Workers

### Radio Stations Not Loading?
1. **CORS Issues**: Should not occur with Radio Browser API
2. **API Quota**: Radio Browser API is free and unlimited
3. **Network**: Check internet connection
4. **Console Errors**: Check browser console for API errors

### Service Worker Issues?
1. **Clear Cache**: DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
2. **Force Update**: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Update
3. **Check Registration**: Look for registration errors in console

### Audio Not Playing?
1. **User Interaction**: Modern browsers require user click first
2. **HTTPS Required**: GitHub Pages provides this automatically
3. **Station URL**: Some stations may be offline
4. **Console Errors**: Check for audio-related errors

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Create `CNAME` file in repository root
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `radiowave.yourdomain.com`)
3. Configure DNS at your domain provider
4. Update manifest.json `start_url` if needed

### Icon Generation
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates basic icons, but for better results:

1. Create a 512×512 PNG icon
2. Use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net)
3. Replace files in `/icons/` folder
4. Commit and push changes

### Performance Optimization
- Icons are cached by service worker
- API responses cached for 5 minutes
- Static files cached indefinitely
- Lighthouse PWA score should be 90+

## 📊 Testing Your PWA

### Lighthouse Audit
1. Open your deployed site
2. DevTools → Lighthouse
3. Check "Progressive Web App"
4. Run audit
5. Should score 90+ in all categories

### PWA Features Test
```javascript
// Test service worker in console
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
    console.log('SW ready:', reg);
});

// Test install prompt
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
    console.log('Install prompt available');
});
```

## 🌟 Pro Tips

### 1. **Repository Naming**
- Use descriptive name like `radiowave-pwa`
- Shorter names work better for GitHub Pages URLs

### 2. **Branch Management**
- Deploy from `main` or `master` branch
- GitHub Actions workflow is pre-configured

### 3. **Mobile Testing**
- Test on actual mobile devices
- Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Test offline functionality thoroughly

### 4. **Updates**
- Push changes to trigger re-deployment
- Service worker automatically updates
- Users get updates on next visit
